                <p>Detecting plant diseases early is crucial for maintaining healthy crops and ensuring food security.
                    Early detection allows for timely intervention, which can prevent the spread of disease and minimize
                    crop loss. By identifying diseases before symptoms become severe, farmers can apply targeted
                    treatments, reducing the need for broad-spectrum pesticides and promoting sustainable agriculture.
                    Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective disease management, saving time, resources, and
                    ultimately protecting the environment.
